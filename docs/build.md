# build.pl

This is a very handy script to reduce the amount of time needed on the developers side to learn CMake commands.

## Running

1. Make sure you cd into the repository and not run the script from anywhere else.
2. Strawberry Perl __must__ be installed to allow the script to execute.
3. On windows from Powershell the script can be ran with ``./build`` (this just executes build.bat which is an entrypoint into build.pl)
4. > $ ./build --help
